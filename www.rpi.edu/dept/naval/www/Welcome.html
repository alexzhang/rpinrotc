    <h2> Did you know?</h2>
    <p>RPI is one of the few colleges that awards free room and board for all NROTC scholarship students.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>What is NROTC?</h2>
    <p>The NROTC Program was established to educate and train qualified young men and women for service as commissioned officers in the unrestricted line Naval Reserve or Marine Corps Reserve. As the largest single source of Navy and Marine Corps officers, the NROTC Scholarship Program plays an important role in preparing mature young men and women for leadership and management positions in an increasingly technical Navy and Marine Corps. Selected applicants for the NROTC Scholarship Program are awarded scholarships through a highly competitive national selection process, and receive full tuition, books, fees and other financial benefits at many of the country's leading colleges and universities. Upon graduation, Midshipmen are commissioned as officers in either the Navy or Marine Corps as active duty officers.</p>
    <p>The NROTC Scholarship Program is available to qualified students who graduate from high school before August 1st of the year they intend to start college. Students selected for the NROTC Scholarship Program make their own arrangements for college enrollment and room and board, and take the normal course load required by the college or university for degree completion. Additionally, scholarship midshipmen are required to follow specific academic guidelines. Full information concerning the NROTC Scholarship Program is available from any of the colleges and universities with NROTC units or from Navy and Marine Corps recruiters.</p>
