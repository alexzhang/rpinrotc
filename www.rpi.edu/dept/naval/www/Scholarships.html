    <h2>National Four-Year Scholarship</h2>
    <p>Students are selected from national competition and are appointed as Midshipman in the U.S. Navy or Marine Corps Reserve.  During this period, the government pays for college tuition, authorized fees, a textbook stipend, a subsistence allowance and provides uniforms.  Upon graduation, Midshipmen are Commissioned as either Navy Ensigns or Marine Corps Second Lieutenants.   Midshipmen will have military service obligations of eight years in unrestricted line (surface, submarine, aviation), at least 
	five of which must be active duty. These minimums do not apply for Nurse 
	Corps and Marine Option Midshipmen.</p>
	  <p>The Navy is preparing our officer corps of the future to meet the 
	  dynamic challenges in the next generation of technology and leadership. In 
	  structuring our academic programs to meet these challenges, undergraduate 
	  academic majors for NROTC Navy option midshipmen are divided into three 
	  categories or tiers: Tier 1 - engineering programs of Navy interest, Tier 
	  2 - other engineering, math and science programs, Tier 3 - Foreign 
	  language and remaining academic programs. In order to keep pace in this 
	  high tech and diverse environment, approximately 85% of Navy Option NROTC 
	  scholarships offers will be awarded to students interested in completing a 
	  Tier 1 or Tier 2 academic major. </p>

      &middot; Students that have more than one year of college credit are not eligible for the four-year scholarship and should discuss other options with the NROTC unit at the university which they attend</p>
    <h2>National Two-Year Scholarship</h2>
    <p>Students are selected through national competition from applicants having at least 2 years of academic study remaining for a baccalaureate degree.  Those enrolled as Two-Year Scholarship Program students have the same privileges and obligations as those enrolled in the Four-Year Scholarship Program.  Applicants must meet the above requirements as well as the following:<br />
      <br />
      &middot; You must have at least two years of college with a 2.5 GPA or better;<br />

    <h2>Cross-town Affiliates</h2>
    <p>NROTCU RPI is currently affiliated with 
    Union College.  Those student attend their normal college classes and then commute to RPI to complete their NROTC requirements.</p>
    <h2>College Program</h2>
    <p>Students who have not been awarded a four year scholarship can still participate in NROTC through a program called the College Program. These midshipmen pay their own way through college while still participating in NROTC. College Program midshipmen who achieve a 2.5 GPA or better can be submitted for a Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) Controlled Scholarship. These scholarships range from 2 to 3 years and have all the same benefits as the four year scholarship. While competition for CNET Scholarships is rigorous, our midshipmen have had tremendous success in picking up two or three year scholarships.</p>
